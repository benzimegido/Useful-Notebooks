# Useful-Notebooks

This is a repository for Jupyter notebooks that I'm using in my discussions and presetations to various audience. 
It is covering different topics from how to use Amazon AI set of APIs, to building your first neural network using PyTorch, 
or how to use SageMaker from efficently.
