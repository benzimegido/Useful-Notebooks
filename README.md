# Useful-Notebooks

This is a repository for Jupyter notebooks that I'm using in my discussions and presetations to various audience. 
It is covering different topics from how to use Amazon AI set of APIs, to building your first neural network using PyTorch, or how to use SageMaker from efficently.

## Amazon AI Examples

The first journey to AI should start with using existing API that are able to solve many of the topics that we want AI to do, such as voice-to-text, text-to-voice, machine translation, natural language understanding and computer vision. [This notebook](https://github.com/guyernest/Useful-Notebooks/blob/master/AmazonAIDemos.ipynb) is showing how to use some of the Amazon AI services such as Polly, Rekognition, Translate and others and how to combine them together.
